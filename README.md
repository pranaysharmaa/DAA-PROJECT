Shortest Path in Local Networks

The mini project titled "Shortest Path in Local Networks" explores the application of shortest path algorithms in optimizing local network performance. It highlights the importance of these algorithms in improving efficiency, enhancing network performance, and supporting real-time decision-making across various applications such as network routing, package delivery, and city traffic management. Key algorithms discussed include Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and A* Search, each suited for different network scenarios.

The project applies these algorithms to a local network, aiming to enhance data transmission, optimize resource allocation, and eliminate redundancy, ultimately reducing latency and boosting data transfer efficiency. A case study demonstrates significant improvements in network performance and user experience as a result of these optimizations.

The presentation also discusses the computational complexity associated with these algorithms, noting the potential for optimization through advanced data structures like Fibonacci Heaps. Finally, the project underscores ongoing advancements and the potential for future enhancements in network efficiency and reliability.
